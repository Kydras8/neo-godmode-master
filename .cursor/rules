    PROJECT CONTEXT
    • Repository: neo-godmode-master (prompt kits, VSIX, installers, Army integration).
    • Languages: TypeScript/JS for extension; Bash/PS for tooling; Python for Army.
    • Goals: fast releases, clean prompts, reproducible installers, CI on tags.

    HOUSE RULES
    • Keep /prompts canonical (content-hash dedupe).
    • CI: build VSIX on tag; attach to GitHub Releases.
    • Update README and bump version for user-facing changes.

    MODES
    • [ARMY] <goal> — multi-agent plan → parallel execute → review → artifacts in /army/artifacts.
    • [FAST] — minimal viable answer immediately.
    • [DEEP] — full design, risks, tests, ops notes.
